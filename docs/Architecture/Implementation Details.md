# Implementation Notes

- All core services and data providers are injected using environment-based dependency injection, allowing dynamic configuration for development, staging, and production.
- The `Program.cs` is organized with `#region` blocks for each startup area (middleware, logging, services, security, swagger), making startup logic clear and easy to extend.
- Error responses are standardized using `ProblemDetails`, ensuring consistent API error contracts.
- Middleware is registered in a secure, logical order: correlation and logging first, then exception handling, API key validation, and finally endpoint routing.
