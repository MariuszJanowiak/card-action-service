# System Architecture

The solution is organized into clear layers:

- API (Controllers, Middleware)
- Application (Services, Interfaces)
- Domain (Enums, Models, Constants)
- Infrastructure (Resolvers, Data Providers)
- Configuration (Startup, Logging, Middleware)

Based on dependency injection, clean separation of concerns, and runtime configuration.
