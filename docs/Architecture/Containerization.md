# Containerization

- `Dockerfile` — basic template for building a container image of the API
- `compose.yaml` — example for running the API using Docker Compose
- `.dockerignore` — defines which files and folders are excluded from the container build

The API is ready for containerized environments out of the box.  
You can run it locally, in the cloud, or integrate with CI/CD using these templates.

No advanced Docker configuration is required for this project.  
The provided files are clean and simple, and can be easily extended as needed.
