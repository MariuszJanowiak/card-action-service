# Project Objective

The system exposes a banking API that resolves allowed actions based on card type, status and PIN availability.

### Key Features

- Card data resolved from injected provider (mock/sql/kafka)
- Matrix-based action rule engine
- Secure endpoint access (API Key)
- Validation via FluentValidation
- Fast response and high readability

### Context

Developed during the technical recruitment process as a standalone card logic resolver.  
Focus was put on clean architecture, environment configuration and real-world middleware handling.
