# Card Action API

Welcome to the Card Action API â€” a secure, efficient, and extensible solution for determining allowed actions on Credit, Debit, and Prepaid banking cards.

Built with production standards in mind:
- Modern, modular architecture (.NET 8)
- Strong validation and security by default
- Flexible configuration for any environment
- Fully tested and ready for real-world integration

This project was created for a technical recruitment process, but delivers everything you'd expect from a professional-grade API.

## Requirements

The API is designed to meet real-world standards for banking systems, with the following core requirements:

- Expose a REST endpoint that returns allowed actions for a banking card based on its type, status, and flags
- Enforce input validation and consistent error responses
- Require API key authentication
- Use matrix-driven business logic, fully separated from infrastructure
- Support multiple environments (Development, Staging, Production)
- Apply clean, layered architecture (API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- Include comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
- Provide documentation (Swagger, MkDocs)
- Enable easy deployment and containerization (Docker support)

These requirements ensure the API is robust, secure, and easy to extend or adapt to production needs.
